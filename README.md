# Open 3D Wheelchair Project
In most developing countries, owning a wheelchair for those in need can be a huge luxury that is difficult to imagine. Coming from a less developed country myself, I have seen many physically challenged people finding it hard to own a wheelchair. In countries like Cameroon where the average per capital income is less 200 Dollars, buying a wheelchair is not a priority even though this is inevitable for the physically challenged. The demand for it in hospitals is also increasing recently.

With this in mind, I am initiating an Open 3D Wheelchair project, not just to facilitate the production process but also to make an open design available for communities. Contribution from anyone around the world is very appreciated and welcome.

The current design is version 1.0 of the project. Updates about the process of making the wheelchair following the design shall provided in the nearest future. The whole idea is to make DIY wheelchair.
A rendered image is shown below. All modeling was done in Solidworks 2018. The project is inspired from conventional wheelchair design models.

In future, I am going to add an electric motor in the wheels to make it an electric wheelchair. I am also accepting modification of the model from contributors.
Please feel free to contact me.
